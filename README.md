# Scoundrel
Implementation of the card game "scoundrel"

# TODO
* Make the game look good, with card sprites, animations for the cards, etc.
* Add a tutorial that explains the game
* Allow to fight bare-handed whenever you want, instead of only when it can't stack
* You can't skip a room once you started playing it
* Allow to discard hearts whenever, just add a warning
